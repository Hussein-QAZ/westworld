            <li><strong>The producing company:</strong>HBO</li>
            <li><strong>Release year:</strong>2022</li>

              <strong>The story</strong>Humanity has lost the war, with
              Charlotte Hale's host copy having filled the power vacuum left
              behind by Engerraund Serac and his Rehoboam, ascending as the sole
              power over Delos after deposing William and replacing him with an
              identical host loyal to her. Charlotte succeeds in taking control
              of the world by removing world leaders and installing hosts in
              their place, simultaneously deploying a bioengineered virus that
              infects humans over the course of a generation, making them
              susceptible to her and other hosts' orders, effectively reversing
              the power dynamic between humans and hosts.
